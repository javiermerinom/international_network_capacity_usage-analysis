## 🏗️ Project Context

•	Dashboard built during my time as a Business Analyst at CNT, Ecuador.

## 📌 Project Overview

This dashboard was developed as an analytical tool to evaluate the saturation of international connections. It enables analysts to decide when to contract or activate new links based on remaining capacity, and to identify opportunities for load balancing.

It integrates three tables with network information and includes custom measures to calculate KPIs such as usage rate and saturation thresholds.
